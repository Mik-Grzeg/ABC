### Artificial Bee Colony algorithm
That was one of my university assignment.
Objective was to write an artificial bee colony algorithm to minimize a given function and create some kind of a summary.

**ABC** class initalizer takes few parameters fe. objective function that we want to minimize.  
Method **optimize** tracks costs and parameters.

There are also helping functions that create summary statistics and plot for a few runs of optimizing algorithm.
